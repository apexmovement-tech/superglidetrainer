      <strong>Mouse and keyboard:</strong>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          It's common to put your crouch on a button next to your jump input, so you can press them both with 1 finger at the same time. <code>C</code
          >,<code>V</code>
          or <code>B</code> with spacebar for example.
        </li>
        <li>
          The simplest way to alter the delay and which button you hit first is to manually correct it by holding your thumb in a different way. This
          might feel strange at first but often this can already make a 1 -3 frame difference. And with practice you can get consistent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Different keycap profiles will naturally alter which button you hit first. So flipping over your crouch keycap can help. As well as getting
          different keycaps. Or taping stuff to your existing keycaps.
        </li>
        <li>Some folks have seen success by jumping or crouching with Scrollwheel.</li>
        <li>
          Your keyboard switches will also alter when a key is activated. Tactile switches like MX blues make it much easier to feel the activation
          point, and putting different switches on your <code>C</code>,<code>V</code>
          and <code>B</code> then on Spacebar might help with activation as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          The ultimate hardware change would be to get a new keyboard. Either to get away from a low polling rate & weird keystroke scan issues which
          introduce further randomness or make it outright impossible. Or to get a keyboard with activation points you can change. Like from Wooting
          or the Apex Pro Mini from Steelseries. Potential keyboard scan issues and how to resolve them without getting new hardware are further
          explained in the FAQ below.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <strong>Controller:</strong> <br />
      For controller the eastiest way is to press either A+B with one finger or X+Square with one finger.

      <h5 class="title is-4 is-underlined">Get better at timing the Superglide during the mantle</h5>
      <div class="subtitle is-6">
        You need to do the Superglide Inputs in the last 0.1-0.2 sec of a mantle. For a start it can help to practice this on the same ledge over and
        over till you are consistent with that. It also helps to practice with the same legend. Since they have different body heights it's easier to
        get used how a mantle looks on the same legend. Additionally you can use different cues to help with the timing:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Audio cue</strong><br />There is a distinct, higher pitched hand grab sound effect at the end of a mantle. That starts at around
            0.3-0.25 sec before the mantle finishes. So timing your Superglide just as its about to end or slightly after it ended is perfect. How
            that timing feels between your headset/speaker latency and hand-ear/eye coordination might be different. So you might time it with or
            before the audio-cue happens.
            <a href="https://youtu.be/i7jfEFrJ4sw">Here</a> is what that sounds and looks like.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visual cue</strong><br />You can also time it with the camera movement. Check in the top left or right corner. You view goes from
            wobbling to completely still a few frames before the Superglide-window closes. So some people time it using that. I zoomed into the
            corners in the
            <a href="https://youtu.be/i7jfEFrJ4sw">audio-trigger video</a> to make it more obvious.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Using these cues is only good for practice. Trying to do Superglides in game during gunfights with cues is almost impossible. So use the cues to
        practise the timing and then start to get used to it by feeling.
        <br />
        One last timing tip: If you don't gain any speed of the ledge you hit the Superglide to early in the mantle.
